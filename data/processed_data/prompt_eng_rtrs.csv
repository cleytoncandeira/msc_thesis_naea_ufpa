Criteria,Text,Describe,Reco
1.1,"All applicable local and national legislation is known and complied with. Note: In group certification of small farms, group managers shall train members on applicable laws and compliance.","1.1.1 There is demonstrable knowledge of responsibilities under applicable laws; 1.1.2 Applicable laws are being complied with; 1.1.3 Producers must not engage in any act of corruption, extortion or embezzlement, or in any form of bribery - including (but not limited to) promising, offering, giving or accepting any undue inducement, whether monetary or otherwise.","Guidance 1.1.1 - 1.1.2 Producers need access to information to know what is required of them by law. Examples include keeping a register of laws or access to relevant legal advice. Compliance with legal requirements should be verified through: checking publicly available data on compliance, where available; interviews with officials and stakeholders; and field observations.  The National Interpretation of the corresponding country will define the scope of verification of the applicable law that producers need to comply with and provide evidence of compliance during the audit. Guidance 1.1.3 Large producers should have written systems and policies in place to manage bribery risks in their organizations. These systems should: a. Identify and monitor those parts of the company that present a high risk of incurring bribery. b. Train relevant managers and employees on the policies and procedures. The system can also include: c. Records of relevant gifts (to and from third parties) in a gift register, in accordance with company policy. d. Investigations of any incidents of suspected bribery within the organization. e. Sanctions for bribery and attempted bribery. The definition of large producers/large producers will be established at national level. In countries where legislation related to the subject already exists, compliance with these laws will be considered sufficient for compliance with this indicator."
1.2,"Land use rights are clearly defined and demonstrable. Note: The land use rights of traditional land users are considered in Criterion 3.2, which should be cross-referenced with this Criterion.","1.2.1 Documentary evidence of land use rights exists (e.g. title deed, lease agreement, court order, etc.).",
1.3,"There is continuous improvement against the requirements of this standard. Note: In group certification, continuous improvement can be recorded and monitored for the group as a whole.","1.3.1 From the assessment required in 4.1.1, the social, environmental and agricultural aspects of the operation (on and off farm) that need to be improved have been identified. Note: Producers are free to choose the most relevant continuous improvement indicators in each context to prove that there have been continuous improvements in relation to the requirements of this standard; e.g. soil carbon content, use of agrochemicals, riparian forest status, etc. The year used for the baseline is the year of the first certification assessment. 1.3.3 Monitoring results are analyzed and, where necessary, appropriate action is planned and carried out to ensure continuous improvement.","Guidance 1.3.1 - 1.3.2 - 1.3.3 It is recognized that sometimes specific continuous improvement indicators may not show improvement due to circumstances beyond the control of the certificate holder.  The producer will monitor and review, at least annually, 1 indicator per pillar of the RTRS Data Collection Sheet to ensure continuous improvement.  The use of the RTRS Data Collection Sheet serves only as guidance for producers and its use is optional. Guidance 1.3.3 RTRS Standard for Responsible Soy Production V4.0 Monitoring is carried out internally by the producer or group manager. An external auditor analyzes the results of the process monitoring and verifies the improvements made."
2.1,"Child labor, forced labor, discrimination and harassment do not occur and are not supported. ","2.1.1 No form of forced, compulsory, bonded, trafficked or involuntary labor is used at any stage of production. 2.1.2 No worker is required to leave their identity documents with other people and no part of their wages, benefits or belongings is retained by the owner or third parties, unless required by law. 2.1.3 Spouses and children of hired workers are not obliged to work on the farm. 2.1.4 Children and minors under the age of 18 must not carry out dangerous work or any work that could endanger their physical integrity or their mental or moral well-being. 2.1.5 Children under the age of 15 (or older, depending on national legislation) must not carry out productive work. Note: in the case of family farming, please refer to the Guidance. 2.1.6. All children of direct employees and residents of the farm must have access to school education. 2.1.7 There is a policy in place that illustrates the farms commitment not to engage in, support or tolerate any form of discrimination. 2.1.8 For the same work, all workers receive equal pay, equal access to training and benefits and equal opportunities for promotion and filling all available vacancies. 2.1.9 Workers are not subject to corporal punishment, mental or physical oppression or coercion, verbal or physical abuse, sexual harassment or any other type of intimidation. 2.1.10 Workers have a safe and effective channel to report abuses and ensure that their rights are respected","Guideline 2.1 Proof of relevant personal data on workers (e.g. gender and date of birth) should be verified. The data collected should be appropriate to the location and legislation in force (for example, in some countries it may not be appropriate - or even legal - to ask employees about their religion). Guideline 2.1.1 Employees should be free to leave the workplace after working hours; they should also be free to terminate the employment relationship, provided that proper notice is given. Reference: ILO Convention 29 on Forced Labor and Convention 105 on the Abolition of Forced Labor. Guideline 2.1.3 Farms need to provide an adequate structure for children and spouses to live on the farm and carry out their personal activities, ensuring a safe distance from potentially dangerous operational areas. Guideline 2.1.4 - 2.1.5 Farms need to provide an adequate structure for children and spouses to live on the farm and carry out their personal activities, ensuring a safe distance from potentially hazardous operational areas. Reference: ILO Convention 138 on Minimum Age and 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. 2.1.5 Participation in certain agricultural activities is not always considered child labor. Age-appropriate tasks - which are lower risk and do not interfere with childrens study and leisure time - can be a normal part of growing up in rural environments. Especially in the context of family farming, livestock and small-scale fish farming, the limited participation of children in non-hazardous activities can be positive, as it contributes to the intergenerational transfer of technical and social skills and to childrens food security. Young people involved in some aspects of agricultural work tend to display higher levels of self-confidence, self-esteem and competence at work. Therefore, when considering working hours and conditions, age, activities and the dangers involved, it is important to clarify the distinction between light tasks - which do not cause harm to children - and child labor, which interferes with compulsory education and causes damage to health and personal development.Guideline 2.1.6 Farms ensure that children have adequate transportation and school supplies available. Guideline 2.1.6-2.1.7 Discrimination includes, but is not limited to: Distinction, exclusion or preference that invalidates or impairs equal opportunity or treatment in employment, whether in the hiring process, compensation, access to training, promotion, discharge, lateral transfer or retirement, including: a) Ethnicity, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender, caste, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin; b) Nationality or migratory status; c) Marital status or social class; d) Medical condition (including seropositivity or disability); e) Family status, including pregnant women and parents with children or any other condition protected by current legislation; f) Being a member or organizer of a workers organization; g) Having filed complaints through the complaints and grievances mechanisms; h) Gender inequality in remuneration* and unequal opportunities between genders in the appointment of management positions; i) Political, religious, social, sexual or cultural opinions and convictions, views or affiliations of workers. * Divergence in salary is not considered discriminatory when the company has a policy, of which employees are fully aware, which specifies different pay scales for different levels of qualification, experience, etc. Reference: ILO Convention 100 on Equal Remuneration and ILO Convention 111 on Discrimination. Guideline 2.1.10 There are open and permanent channels of communication between employers and employees.  "
2.2,Workers - directly and indirectly employed on the farm - and tenants are properly informed and trained for their tasks and aware of their rights and duties.,"The term workers indirectly employed on the farm refers here to employees of service providers who perform services directly related to the production process. The scope of services directly related to the production process will be defined in national interpretations. In countries that do not require formal employment contracts between the worker and the employer, other proof of the employment relationship must be provided (e.g. the employees registration with the social security/employment agency).Guideline 2.2.1 In the case of illiterate workers, the guidelines of local rules should be followed to convey the content of the contract and ensure full understanding of all clauses. Guideline 2.2.3 If there are no regulations on the frequency of health and safety training sessions, such training should be carried out at least once a year. Here are some possible situations in which the producer should offer training (if relevant):Handling, storage and disposal of pesticides; Occupational health and safety in the vicinity of biodigesters, manure pits, effluent lagoons Fertilizer choice, purchase, application rate and placement (based on soil and crop characteristics) Risks of soil loss and degradation Stopping deforestation, loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services Energy and water scarcity (energy efficiency, sustainable irrigation systems, etc.).) Waste minimization, segregation, storage and disposal on the farm.  Other sustainable practices Workers fundamental duties and rights A training plan is created to ensure that all training, including that required by law, is up to date and that all farmers and relevant workers receive the training within 2 years of the first assessment. Training records are kept with gender-disaggregated information on trainees.","2.2.1 Workers (including temporary workers), tenants, contractors and subcontractors have a written agreement, in a language they can understand and in accordance with local laws. Note: The requirements of indicator 2.2.1 are recommended in all cases. However, on small farms with high illiteracy rates, group managers can implement alternative mechanisms to verify the validity of employment relationships and make them known to everyone. 2.2.2 Labor laws, union agreements or direct employment contracts, with details of payments and conditions of employment (e.g. working hours, deductions, overtime, sickness, vacations, maternity leave, reasons for dismissal, notice period, etc.) are available in language understood by workers or have been carefully explained to them by a manager or supervisor. 2.2.3 Adequate and appropriate training and understandable instructions on fundamental labor rights, health and safety - as well as any other necessary supervision or guidance - are provided to all workers. Note on 2.2.3: In the case of Group Certification of small farmers, managers may organize periodic training sessions for group workers."
2.3 ,A safe and healthy workplace is guaranteed to all workers.,"2.3.1 Producers and their employees demonstrate knowledge and understanding of health and safety issues. 2.3.2 Relevant health and safety risks are identified, procedures to address these issues are developed by employers and these are monitored. 2.3.3 Potentially hazardous tasks are performed only by capable and competent people without specific health problems.2.3.4 Adequate and appropriate protective clothing and equipment is provided and used in all potentially hazardous operations, such as the handling and application of pesticides and manual or mechanized operations. 2.3.5 Mechanisms are in place to verify workers compliance with safety requirements. 2.3.6 Procedures are in place for accidents and emergencies; instructions are clearly understood by all workers. 2.3.7 In the event of an accident or illness, first aid is accessible and medical assistance is provided without delay. 2.3.8 Producers ensure regular maintenance of machinery and equipment to ensure their safe operation. ","Guideline 2.3 References: ILO Convention 155 on Safety and Health of Workers; ILO Convention 184 on Safety and Health in Agriculture; ILO Recommendation 192 on Safety and Health in Agriculture. The means of verification used must be appropriate to the size and scale of the operation. Ex: (2.3.1) There must be a documented health and safety policy in operations with permanent employees. On small farms, this can be demonstrated through oral explanations. Guideline 2.3.2 Workers or their representatives (e.g. trade unions and/or womens groups) should be involved in identifying safety risks and defining priority actions. Guideline 2.3.3 If not already required by law, an occupational health and safety risk assessment should be carried out to identify which types of work can be carried out by each category of workers, as well as their respective risks.  Guideline 2.3.5 There is a system of warnings, followed by sanctions permitted by law, for workers who fail to comply with safety requirements.  Guideline 2.3.6 Procedures in the event of accidents and emergencies should include immediate measures to stop all operations in places where there is a serious and imminent danger to health and safety - and, if necessary, evacuation of the site. Workers are trained in this area by a qualified professional.  Guideline 2.3.8 Maintenance must follow the technical guidelines provided by the manufacturers and evidence - such as maintenance plans or service reports - must be stored.  "
2.4,All workers enjoy freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.,"2.4.1 All workers and tenants enjoy the right to establish and/or join an organization of their choice. 2.4.2 The effective functioning of these organizations is not impeded. Representatives are not subject to discrimination and have access, whenever requested, to their members in the workplace. 2.4.3 All workers have the right to collective bargaining. 2.4.4 Workers are not prevented from interacting with external parties outside of working hours (e.g. NGOs, trade unions, labor inspectors, agricultural extension workers, certification bodies).",Guideline 2.4.1 Reference: ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize.  Guideline 2.4.3 Reference: ILO Convention 98 on the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining.  Workers indirectly employed on the farm' refers here to employees of service providers who perform services directly related to the production process. The scope of 'services directly related to the production process' will be defined in national interpretations.
2.5,"All workers on the farm, employed directly or indirectly, have remuneration at least equal to the amount provided for in national legislation and sectoral agreements.","2.5.1 Workers gross salaries are in accordance with national legislation and sectoral agreements and are paid at least monthly. 2.5.2 There are no salary deductions of a disciplinary nature, unless this is permitted by legislation. Remuneration and benefits are detailed and made clear to workers; workers are paid in a way that suits them. Wages paid are recorded by the employer. 2.5.3 Normal working hours do not exceed 48 hours per week. Overtime does not exceed 12 hours per week. 2.5.4 If additional overtime is required, the following conditions must be met: a) It only takes place during limited periods of time (e.g. peak harvest, planting season). b) If there is a union or representative organization, the conditions of overtime are negotiated and agreed with the organization. c) If there is no union or agreement with a representative organization, the average working hours over the two-month period following the start of the exceptional period must not exceed 60 hours per week. 2.5.5 The hours worked by employees are recorded by the employer. In the case of indirect workers, working hours will be recorded where possible. 2.5.6 Overtime work is always voluntary and paid in accordance with the law or industry standards. When overtime is required, workers receive timely notification. Workers are entitled to at least one day off for every six consecutive days of work. 2.5.7 With regard to maternity, salaried workers enjoy all the rights and protections provided for in national practices and laws. Workers on maternity leave have the right to return to their jobs under the same terms and conditions as before the leave. They are not subject to any kind of discrimination, loss of position or reduction in salary. 2.5.8 If workers are paid by results, a normal 8-hour working day enables workers (men and women) to receive at least the minimum wage defined nationally or by sector.  2.5.9 All employees receive drinking water on the farm. If employees live on the farm, they also have access to affordable and adequate housing and food, as well as toilets and places to wash their hands. When these services are charged for, the prices are in line with market conditions. Housing is safe and has at least basic sanitation. ",'Workers indirectly employed on the farm' refers here to employees of service providers who perform services directly related to the production process. The scope of 'services directly related to the production process' will be defined in the national interpretations.  Guideline 2.5.2 The criterion applies to permanent and seasonal workers involved in agricultural production.  Guideline 2.5.5-2.5.6 Reference: ILO Convention 1 on Hours of Work.
3.1,"Channels are available for communication and dialogue with the local community (including indigenous peoples) on issues related to the soy farms activities and their impacts. Note: In this way, they will participate effectively and meaningfully in decisions on matters that affect them.","3.1.1 There is documentary evidence of the existence of communication and dialogue channels. The channels enable adequate communication between the producer and the community.  3.1.2 Local communities have been informed of the communication channels, which enable communications to be anonymous (if so desired)","Guideline 3.1 Communication channels for submitting complaints and grievances should use local languages and appropriate means (e.g. the Internet is not an appropriate mechanism for communicating with communities that do not have access to the web). Communication requirements must be adequate for the identification of any disputes with traditional land users, as referred to in Criterion 3.2 In cases where it is demonstrated that people on (or next to) the property are there illegally (e.g. squatters), producers must try to establish communication, but are not obliged to maintain a dialogue. Local communities and other private rights groups can be represented by legitimate representatives in cases of communication or negotiation or in audit situations. When this occurs, the producer or auditor is not exempt from the responsibility to communicate with other members of the community - especially the poor, illiterate, youth, women or indigenous groups. Evidence of compliance with this indicator can be notifications sent to neighbors and adjacent local communities. It is important to include interviews with community members to assess the existence of communication channels and their adequacy. Guideline 3.1.1 Communication should be managed in a way that corresponds to the importance of each issue. Critical issues require systematic communication, while non-critical issues depend on reactive communication. In the case of small farms, documentary evidence is not required - it can be replaced by oral evidence. Evidence of compliance with this indicator can be notifications presented to neighbors and adjacent local communities. Some (non-exhaustive) examples of communication channels: communication of information to third parties, including the contact person on the farm, the telephone number and/or e-mail address, etc.) "
3.2,"In areas with traditional land users, including indigenous peoples, conflicting land uses are avoided or resolved.","3.2.1 In the event of a dispute regarding use rights; a comprehensive, participatory and documented assessment of community rights is carried out. 3.2.2 In cases where traditional land users give up their rights, there is documentary evidence that the affected communities have received compensation and have given free, prior, informed and documented consent. 3.2.3 Producers must respect the rights, customs and cultures of indigenous peoples, under the terms of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007) and ILO Convention 169 (1989). 3.2.4 Sites of cultural, ecological, economic or religious importance and resources fundamental to meeting the basic needs of all traditional communities, local communities and indigenous peoples (subsistence, health, nutrition, water, etc.) must be clearly identified in conjunction with the groups in question, as well as recognized and protected by farm managers.   ","When applying for certification, producers shall identify local communities and traditional land users. Traditional land users shall provide reasonable proof that they have been exercising the right to use or access the area or the ecosystem services derived from the area for the last ten years, prior to May 2009. Reasonable evidence can be based on specific criteria that are directly relevant to their purposes (for example: valid / up-to-date official / letterhead documents, recognized by employees and employers). In the case of traditional indigenous communities, Articles 14-18 of ILO Convention 169 also apply. Traditional land users can be represented by legitimate representatives for the purposes of communication, negotiation or auditing. When this occurs, the producer or auditor is not exempt from the responsibility to communicate with other members of the community.The community rights assessment should seek to: a) identify the individual and collective rights and uses of local communities and traditional land users; and b) identify the uses of water resources (if any); c) identify the sites and landscape conditions necessary to guarantee the fulfillment of these rights; d) identify the sites/issues where there are conflicts between property rights and traditional land use rights and ecosystem services; e) find a solution to resolve possible conflicts in land use and/or reach an agreement on the compensation proposal. Whenever there are final decisions, the terms of the decision will be respected. In the event of a contentious process, while it is sub judice (in litigation, pending a decision), this will not prevent access to certification, as long as the guidelines determined by the judge are observed. In the absence of such guidelines, traditional land users will be able to continue exercising their rights until the case is resolved."
3.3,"A complaints and grievance mechanism is in place and accessible to the local community (including indigenous peoples), staff, other workers and traditional land users. Note: In group certification, the complaints and grievances mechanism can be administered by the group manager and records of complaints and grievances can be kept for the group as a whole",3.3.1 Documentary evidence on complaints and grievances is received and maintained. 3.3.2 All complaints and grievances received are dealt with appropriately and in a timely manner.,"Guideline 3.3.1 Anonymous complaints will also be dealt with. Guideline 3.3.2 If the producer receives a complaint, they are obliged to send a response within 30 days of receiving the complaint to acknowledge its receipt and/or begin to resolve the issue."
3.4,"Fair employment opportunities and provision of goods and services are offered to the local population, regardless of gender or race.","3.4.1 Employment opportunities are advertised locally. 3.4.2 Whenever possible, there is collaboration with training programs aimed at the local population (including, for example, indigenous peoples). Note: Small farms can participate in training programs, if they exist. In the case of groups, collaboration with training programs can take place at the group level. 3.4.3 Opportunities regarding the provision of goods and services are offered to local communities.  ","Evidence may include records on the proportion of local employees employed on the farm. If it is not possible to apply this indicator, justification should be provided to the auditor.Guidance 3.4.3 Refers to goods and services central to production activities. Evidence includes quotes for services received from local suppliers. "
4.1,"The on- and off-site social and environmental impacts have been assessed and appropriate measures have been taken to minimize and mitigate any negative impacts Note: In group certification of small farms, Indicators 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.1.4 and 4.1.5 can be part of the SCI at group level and can also be fulfilled at group level. ","4.1.1 An initial social and environmental assessment is carried out before the first certification audit1 (see also Indicator 1.3.1). This assessment needs to be repeated before operations are expanded. 4.1.2 The assessment is carried out by a person adequately trained and experienced in this task. 4.1.3 The assessment is carried out in a comprehensive and transparent manner. 4.1.4 Measures to minimize or mitigate the impacts identified by the assessment are being documented, implemented and monitored. 4.1.5 A summary of the social and environmental assessment report shall be made available upon request.  ","The assessment shall be appropriate to the scale of the operation. In group certification of small producers, separate groups located in similar areas and facing similar issues can exchange information when preparing and/or carrying out the assessment. However, the reports must be drawn up for the group as a whole. If there are national requirements regarding impact assessments that are appropriate for compliance with this Criterion (identified by the NTF), these requirements must be followed. Where there are no national requirements, the auditors should check that an appropriate process has been followed (e.g. ""the Equator Principles Environmental and Social Assessment Procedure"") Guidance 4.1.1 This assessment should identify endemic, rare, threatened or endangered species (see also indicator 4.5.3).  "
4.2,Pollution is minimized and production waste is managed responsibly. Note: The use and disposal of chemicals is dealt with under Principle 5.,"4.2.1 There is no intentional burning anywhere on the property, whether of plant residues, waste or to clear vegetation. 4.2.2 All waste is properly stored and disposed of (e.g. fuel, batteries, tires, lubricants, sewage).  4.2.3 Adequate structures are in place to prevent spills of oil2 and other pollutants.  4.2.4 Reuse and recycling take place whenever possible.  4.2.5 There is a waste management plan, including all areas of the property.","4.2.1 There are three exceptions to this rule: a) when there is a legal obligation to carry out burning as a sanitary measure; b) when the burned material is used as fuel for drying crops; c) to fight fires Guidance 4.2.2 If there are national rules on the safe storage and disposal of different types of hazardous waste, they must be complied with. In the absence of regulatory rules, advice should be sought on the best options available and recommendations made. All waste disposal and composting areas on the farm (e.g. for household waste) should be a safe distance from living areas and/or waterways. Measures must be taken to ensure that the farm is clean and tidy. Plastic and other waste should not be left in fields, on field margins, around the farm or on roadsides. Farmers and workers must not throw garbage and other general waste into ditches, streams or wells.  Waste management must take place at the production stage through the management, storage, transportation and disposal of waste streams; there must be no landfilling or uncontrolled dumping of waste in areas not officially designated as landfills. The farm must have a defined procedure for dealing with pollution incidents and mitigating possible damage from contamination and leaks.  Guideline 4.2.4 The producer should adopt Circular Economy practices or explain why they do not apply recycling, if they do not use it and in cases where it would be easy to do so.  Guideline 4.2.5 Waste includes non-organic and organic solid waste, as well as wastewater resulting from the operation (e.g. for cleaning equipment and tanks). In the case of large and medium-sized producers, this should be documented. On small or family farms, producers only need to know what waste is generated on their property and what is done with each of them."
4.3,"There are efforts to reduce emissions and increase sequestration of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) on the farm.  Note: Other issues relevant to GHG emissions are addressed in other principles, including: Fertilizer use (Criterion 5.5), Land use change (Criterion 4.4).   ","4.3.1 The total and direct use of fossil fuels is recorded over time; the volume per hectare and per unit of product is monitored in all activities related to soy production 4.3.2 If there is an increase in the intensity of fossil fuel use, this increase is justified. If there is no justification, there is an action plan to reduce use. Note: In group certification of small producers, Indicators 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 can be part of the SCI at group level.  4.3.3 Soil organic matter is monitored to quantify changes in soil carbon; action is taken to improve or at least mitigate negative trends. Note on 4.3.3: in the case of individual smallholders, compliance with Criterion 5.3 is considered sufficient. In Group Certification of small producers, soil carbon monitoring must be carried out, which can be done through sampling.  4.3.4 Opportunities to increase carbon sequestration through restoration of native vegetation, forest plantations and other means are identified and, where possible, implemented.","The producer shall draw up a plan demonstrating how it will comply with this criterion. The plan should show which targets (% reduction and by when) have been set for which areas, as well as the measures to be taken to achieve these targets.  Guideline 4.3.1 On multi-crop farms, the use of fossil fuels in soybean production should be estimated. 'Activities related to soybean production' include: field operations and transportation on the farm, carried out by both the producer and third parties.  Guideline 4.3.2 There may be annual fluctuations in the intensity of fossil fuel use, due to natural variations in productivity. This trend should be monitored over a period of several years. An example of justification for increasing the intensity of fossil fuel use might be when a crop is lost due to drought and needs to be restarted. The use of renewable energies (biofuels, biogas, solar and wind energy, etc.) is encouraged on the farm. In the case of replacing electricity with renewable energies, the savings equivalent to the use of fossil fuels must be quantified.  Guideline 4.3.4 If producers are unable to implement the opportunities identified to increase carbon sequestration, a justification should be provided to the auditor. Other means may include:  Passively restoring headquarters and roadsides Planting forests Cover crops in non-productive and degraded areas, as well as floodplains or lowlands.  Conserving non-native plantations that were previously used as shade for livestock Building and maintaining ecological corridors to protect biodiversity Note: The implementation of ecological corridors to protect biodiversity requires specific technical guidance from experts in the field."
4.4,The expansion of soybean cultivation is responsible.,"4.4.1 As of May 2009, the following areas have not been cleared or converted: 4.4.1.a When RTRS maps are available: all areas included in Category 1 of maps 3. 4.4.1.b when no RTRS maps are available: a) native forests; b) riparian forests; c) natural wetlands; d) steep slopes; e) areas designated by law to serve the purpose of native conservation and/or cultural and social protection.  4.4.1.c when there are unresolved claims over the use of the land by the traditional users of the land in dispute, without agreement between the parties.  4.4.2 After June 3, 2016, no conversion of natural lands (see Glossary) or steep slopes and in areas designated by law to serve the purpose of native conservation and/or cultural and social protection is allowed.","Guidance 4.4 for Certification Bodies Data collection requirements for future Payment for Environmental Services (PES) schemes: The date of registration of the producer for certification purposes is recorded by the Certification Body. During the certification audit, the area and vegetation types of all voluntary reserves of native vegetation (which go beyond legal requirements) are recorded. After certification, details of the date of registration for certification purposes and the area and vegetation type of the voluntary reserves are entered into an RTRS register. When the RTRS draws up a PES scheme, payments are available retroactively to the date of registration.  The Accountability Framework definitions are recognized for the applicability of these criteria. Guideline 4.4.1 If conversion/compensation occurs due to legal requirements (at national or local level) or verifiable emergency (e.g. firebreak), this indicator does not apply. Legal obligations can include - but are not limited to - the need for roads, transmission lines, etc. Under certain circumstances, a minimum level of conversion may occur if there is a restoration plan in place. Please refer to Annex 8 and the definition of ""minimum conversion level"" in the glossary, according to the Accountability Framework Initiative. Guideline 4.4.1.c Traditional land users shall provide reasonable evidence that they have been exercising use or access to the property area for the 10 years prior to May 2009."
4.5,The farms biodiversity is maintained and safeguarded through the preservation of native vegetation.,"4.5.1 There is a map of the farm indicating native vegetation, production areas and watercourses (see 5.2.1). 4.5.2 There is a plan in place and monitoring to ensure that native vegetation and wildlife are maintained. 4.5.3 Endemic, rare, threatened or endangered species present permanently or temporarily on the property are protected. Hunting or collecting these species is not permitted. 4.5.4 On farms with less than 10% native vegetation (but in compliance with 4.4 and 5.2, as well as other related indicators), producers must implement and promote conservation activities on, off or around the farm to encourage wildlife and the restoration of native vegetation.","Guidance 4.5.1 The map and plan shall be appropriate to the size of the operation. In group certification, the group manager may maintain the map centrally and may be responsible for maintaining and developing a conservation plan. Guideline 4.5.2 The plan should include at least the following:  Identification of existing native vegetation and wildlife on the farm.  Indicators and baseline of the state of native vegetation and wildlife.  Measures to preserve native vegetation and wildlife.  Monitoring. Annex 5 provides an example of how to draw up a plan for this indicator. The plan is carried out by a person suitably trained and experienced in this task (as in 4.1.2). As a form of corroboration, this person will provide evidence of having attended courses and training, as well as the experience described in their CV.  Guidance 4.5.4 Some activities that producers can carry out to comply with this indicator are but are not limited to the following: leaving corridors or restoring fenced borders or paths, restoring degraded or unproductive areas, supporting conservation or restoration activities outside the farm boundaries (but related to local fauna and native vegetation) - e.g. the creation of forest seedling nurseries for later donation to organizations working to establish species and collaboration with institutions focused on conservation activities. This support can be offered through funding or the provision of resources, materials, personnel, etc. Producers can create groups to fulfill this indicator. Producers can organize activities together in order to promote conservation activities on, off or around the farm."
5.1,The quality and supply of surface and groundwater is maintained or improved.,"5.1.1 Good agricultural practices are implemented to promote aquifer recharge and minimize diffuse and localized impacts of chemical residues, fertilizers, erosion or other sources on surface and groundwater quality. 5.1.2 There is a plan that includes monitoring and mitigation measures according to the risks identified and the plan is applicable to the scale. 5.1.3 Any direct evidence of localized contamination of groundwater or surface water is reported and monitored in collaboration with local authorities.  5.1.4 Where irrigation takes place, there is a documented procedure regarding the application of best practices and compliance with legislation. Note: In group certification of small farms - when irrigation is used with crops other than soy, but is not carried out according to best practices - there is a plan in place to improve practices. The group manager is responsible for documentation.  5.1.5 The different uses of water on the farm should be identified.  In activities that use larger volumes of water, the producer must find a way to monitor it. Actions should be implemented to reduce water use wherever possible. ","Guideline 5.1.2 The monitoring plan should define parameters - e.g. pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and electrical conductivity, contamination levels and appropriate testing frequency. Monitoring should be considered at a watershed level. Where wells exist, they should be used to monitor groundwater. The testing laboratory should be independent, but does not necessarily need to be certified.  Guideline 5.1.4 Where irrigation takes place, other potential uses should be considered - such as domestic use or use on other food crops. If there is a shortage of water, human consumption will take priority. For new irrigation systems, an environmental impact assessment is required.  Guideline 5.1.5 Legal and regulatory requirements are sufficient for compliance with this indicator "
5.2,Areas of natural vegetation around springs and along natural watercourses are maintained or restored.,"5.2.1 The locations of all watercourses have been identified and mapped, including the status of riparian vegetation. 5.2.2 In riparian areas where natural vegetation has been removed, there is a plan in the process of being implemented with a restoration schedule.  5.2.3 Natural wetlands are not drained and native vegetation is maintained","Guideline 5.2.2 This indicator applies the requirements of criterion 4.4.  Guideline 5.2.3 The deadline for natural wetlands is May 2009. In smallholder group certification, group managers may maintain the maps centrally and may be responsible for maintaining and developing restoration plans."
5.3,"Soil quality is maintained or improved and erosion is prevented through good management practices. Note: In group certification of small producers, monitoring of soil fertility and quality must be part of the internal control system and can be carried out on a sample basis in the group.","5.3.1 Adequate monitoring of soil quality already takes place, including the collection of samples for fertility assessment.  5.3.2 Knowledge of techniques to preserve the quality (physical, chemical and biological) of the soil is demonstrated and these techniques are implemented. At least 20% of the production area must be no-till. Producers who are unable to meet this threshold will need to justify why.  5.3.3 Knowledge of soil erosion control techniques is demonstrated and these techniques are properly implemented.  5.3.4 A crop rotation plan should be drawn up to avoid planting soybeans immediately on soybeans and to allow a time interval in the field in question. During this interval, a second crop or pasture should be grown or, at the very least, the land should be left fallow or under vegetation cover to regenerate.  This plan should consider adaptation to the specific climatic and agro-ecological conditions of the region.","Guideline 5.3.1 Select appropriate monitoring indicators, which should be based on the main issues relating to the type of production and the region. Whatever the monitoring indicators, they should be simple and produce reliable information. Some suggestions include: Analysis of organic matter, total nitrogen (N) (total N can be estimated at 5% of organic matter), phosphorus (P), pH, electrical conductivity, measurement of surface residues (quality and quantity 30 days before the average sowing date, with a tolerance of +\- 10 days).  Guideline 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 Soil quality maintenance techniques may include:  Conservation agriculture.  Crop rotation.  Precision agriculture Nitrogen-fixing plants Green manures Balanced fertilization. Soil erosion control techniques can include:  Management of roads within the farm.  Managing sloping areas.  Maintaining permanent soil cover.  No-till planting.  Contour seeding Guidance 5.3.3. The RTRS recognizes that not all producers will be able to transition all their crops to no-till in the short term, so it encourages producers to plan for the progressive implementation of no-till over time. The soil management plan should contain at least the following information:  Soil sampling Crop rotation plan, including rotation with grasses Cover crop plan Type, quality and timing of fertilization, with efforts to keep current fertilization levels to a minimum.  Measures to prevent soil compaction Tools to prevent wind and water erosion.  The plan will last at least one full rotation and will be carried out by the Agronomist in charge.  Guidance 5.3.4 The RTRS encourages producers to employ crop rotation. If the following plan is not possible, producers must justify their decision."
5.4,The negative impacts of plant protection products on the environment and health are reduced through the application of systematic and recognized Integrated Crop Management (ICM) techniques,"5.4.1 There is a documented and implemented ICM plan that addresses the use of prevention and other select biological, non-chemical or chemical controls. Note: In group certification of small farms (particularly where people are not literate), the group manager is responsible for developing and documenting the ICM plan, as well as supporting its implementation.  5.4.2 There is a plan in place that contains targets for the reduction of potentially harmful plant protection products over time.  5.4.3 Only original and genuine agrochemical products that meet local registration requirements should be used, to prevent risks to farmers, consumers and the environment.  5.4.4 The use of agrochemical products follows legal requirements and professional recommendations (or, if professional recommendations are not available, the manufacturers recommendations) and includes the rotation of active ingredients to avoid the creation of resistance.  5.4.5 There are records of the monitoring of pests, diseases, weeds and natural predators. Note: In smallholder group certification, records can be included in the ICS for the group as a whole.","Guideline 5.4 Take into account scale and context, especially on smallholder farms - this concerns both the expected level of MIC and the records kept.  Guideline 5.4.2 Parameters monitored include the number of applications of plant protection products per crop, volume of plant protection products used per hectare and toxicological class of the product. For the purposes of this Criterion, the potential damage levels of a plant protection product can be determined from its WHO classification. When targets are not met, justification is provided in the form of documentary evidence. Producers are encouraged to consider using biological products.  Guidance 5.4.4 Local and national laws must be taken into account. Producers should store product safety data sheets in the same place where the products are handled, so that they are easily accessible when needed"
5.5,"All application of agrochemicals4 is documented and there is monitoring of all storage, handling, collection and disposal of chemical residues and empty containers to ensure compliance with good practices.","5.5.1 There are records of the use of agrochemicals, including: a) the products purchased, quantities and dates; and applied; b) the identification of the area where the application was carried out; c) the names of the people who prepared the products and applied them in the field; d) the identification of the application equipment used; e) the weather conditions during the application 5.5.2 Containers are properly stored, washed and disposed of; agrochemical waste and residues are disposed of in an environmentally appropriate manner.  5.5.3 The transportation and storage of agrochemicals is carried out safely and all appropriate health, environmental and safety precautions are taken.  5.5.4 The necessary precautions are taken to prevent people from entering recently sprayed areas.  5.5.5 Fertilizers are used in accordance with professional recommendations (provided by manufacturers where no other professional recommendations are available).","Guidance 5.5.1 Records are kept for at least 5 years. This does not apply to records from years prior to certification. Scale and context must be taken into account, especially on small farms. Certain exceptions may be made (e.g. regarding the keeping of invoices) for small farms in a group, provided that the group has a mechanism in place to ensure compliance with Criterion Guideline 5.5.2 Container washing shall be carried out according to the principles of triple washing (including the reuse of wash water in the mixing tank) or through high-pressure techniques associated with mechanical application.  Guideline 5.5.3 Areas used for the storage and distribution of agrochemicals and flammable and toxic substances are designed, built and equipped to reduce the risk of accidents and negative impacts on human health and the environment. Some suggestions for reducing the risk of accidents and negative impacts are: restricted access, impermeable floor, storage area, containment barrier, safety sheets, instructions in case of accidents, protective equipment, fire extinguishers, first aid, spill elements, minimum and/or forced ventilation, cleaning, separation of seeds, fertilizers and products. The legal requirements must be followed on farms of all sizes.  Guidance 5.5.4 Precautions can include, for example, training on the topic, signage to indicate sprayed areas or a mechanism that informs employees and external actors which areas have been sprayed.  "
5.6,Responsible Use of Agrochemicals.,"5.6.1 Agrochemicals listed in the Stockholm and Rotterdam Conventions are not used.  5.6.2 Agrochemicals should be applied using methods that minimize harm to human health, wildlife, plant biodiversity and water and air quality.",Guideline 5.6.1 Paraquat and Carbofuran are banned according to the Stockholm and Rotterdam Conventions
5.7,"The use of biological control agents is documented, monitored and controlled in accordance with national laws and internationally accepted scientific protocols.","5.7.1 Information on the requirements for the use of biological control agents is available. 5.7.2 Records are kept of all use of biological control agents, demonstrating compliance with national laws.","Guideline 5.7 Records of use of biological control agents shall be used as evidence of compliance with this criterion.  Guideline 5.7.2 Scale and context should be taken into account, especially on small farms.  "
5.8,"Producers may not introduce or use invasive species in the management unit. Systematic measures are planned and implemented to monitor, control and minimize their proliferation and the development of new pests.","5.8.1 In cases where there are institutional systems designed to identify and monitor new pests and introduced invasive species, or major outbreaks of existing pests, producers follow the requirements of these systems to minimize their proliferation.  5.8.2 In cases where there are no such systems, incidences of new pests or invasive species and major outbreaks of existing pests are reported to the competent authorities and relevant producer organizations or research bodies. Note: In group certification, the group manager is responsible for communicating with the relevant authorities and organizations",
5.9,Adequate measures are implemented to avoid drift of agrochemicals into neighboring areas.,"5.9.1 Documented procedures exist that specify good agricultural practices regarding the application of agrochemicals - including minimizing drift - and these procedures are implemented 5.9.2 Records are kept of climatic conditions (wind speed and direction, temperature and relative humidity) during spraying operations.  5.9.3 Aerial application of pesticides is carried out in such a way that it does not impact on populated areas. All aerial applications are preceded by notifications to residents within a 500m radius of the planned application. Note: The term populated areas\ means any house, office or other occupied building.  5.9.4 There is no aerial application of agrochemicals in WHO Classes Ia, Ib and II within 500m of populated areas or bodies of water.  5.9.5 There is no application of pesticides within 30m of populated areas or bodies of water. Note: The term ""water bodies"" includes, but is not limited to, watercourses, intermittent streams, rivers, streams, ponds, springs, lakes, reservoirs and ditches (see Glossary).","Guidance 5.9.1 Factors influencing drift include, but are not limited to, wind speed and direction, temperature, equipment used and topography.  Guideline 5.9.1- 5.9.2 Requirements for small farms should be appropriate to the scale and context. In group certification of small farms - group managers can provide documented procedures and keep records of climatic conditions.  Guidance 5.9.5 An exception may be made for the manual application of chemicals not classified as Ia, Ib, II by the WHO, or if adequate measures are taken to prevent drift (e.g. use of a backpack applicator with shields) and if permitted by law and the manufacturers recommendations."
5.10,Appropriate measures are implemented to enable the coexistence of distinct production systems.,5.10.1 Measures are taken to avoid interference with the production systems of neighboring areas.,"Guideline 5.10.1 Whenever a change in soybean production practices is introduced that could impact neighboring production systems, the producer responsible for the change must implement a 30 m buffer strip (e.g. in areas where production is usually GM, it is up to the organic or non-GM farmer to maintain the buffer zone around their production. In areas with mainly non-GM or organic production, farmers who plant GM crops or use chemicals must maintain a buffer strip). In countries or regions where it has been proven that a buffer strip of less than 30 meters is sufficient to prevent contamination and preserve the purity of neighboring systems, the buffer strip may be smaller and defined according to national practices."
5.11,Seed origin is controlled to improve production and prevent the introduction of new diseases.,"5.11.1 All seed purchased must come from known and legally approved sources.  5.11.2 Self-propagated seeds may be used, provided that proper seed production standards are followed and legal requirements regarding intellectual property rights are met.","Guideline 5.11.1 Producers may use their own seeds, always in accordance with legal requirements."
