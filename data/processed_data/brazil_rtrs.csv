The four farms received non-conformities in item 1.1.2, related to working hours and payments during harvest periods, work safety, environmental licensing, accommodation structures and compliance with water potability standards.",The farms have registrations and lease contracts for all areas of their farms.,"The group manager is responsible for the socio-environmental assessment of all members. Although there is a Social and Environmental Impact Assessment, the four farms received non-conformities in items 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 because they did not have defined indicators and targets for monitoring and analyzing actions related to the assessment.","As verified in interviews and farm records, employees are free to leave the property and there is no evidence of forced or slave-like labor. Only copies of employee documents are kept by the farms. Family members who live on the properties are not forced to work, and opportunities are offered.

The four farms audited record weather conditions during applications. On audited farms that carry out aerial application, the 500 meters distance from populated areas is respected. Land applications respect at least 90 meters from populated areas and bodies of water, as determined by state legislation, except one of them does not respect this limit, which caused NC in indicator 5.9.5","Properties neighboring farms they are occupied with similar production systems, and there are no production systems that require care, such as organic production. No audited farm found records of damage to neighboring areas.","On all audited farms it is possible to guarantee the legal use of the origin of the seeds, where they are acquired from duly qualified companies."

Techniques such as the use of specific crops for pest control are implemented, for example, Crotalaria sp for nematode control, machines are washed when they come from another region - Mato Grosso, MaranhÃ£o - before use, to prevent the entry of nematodes. Monitoring is recorded. There is evidence of a policy of responsible use of agrochemicals and targets to reduce the use of the most dangerous toxicological categories. The objectives are documented in Agrexs sustainability report. The decision to use RR varieties reduces the use of insecticides. Genuine products are used, the pesticide deposit at Faz UniÃ£o is audited, all pesticides are original and genuine. The use and application of pesticides follows the recommendations of production technicians, for example, at Fazenda UniÃ£o, applications and application and dosage recommendations are made by the Farm Agronomist. At Faz Batavo, recommendations are made by a consultant. Rotations of active ingredients are carried out to avoid resistance, the climatic conditions of application are considered to guarantee effectiveness and avoid drifts. The application is carried out through a work order issued by the companys technician.","There is evidence of documented records of the use of agrochemicals, in accordance with the requirements of this standard.

Fertilizers are used in accordance with the recommendations of the Farm technicians and information from the manufacturer. The requirements for use arise from the soil analyzes carried out.","The warehouses, stock list and application records are checked for non-use of products included in the Stockholm and Rotterdam lists. Pesticide warehouses at Faz UniÃ£o and agrochemical application records were audited. At Faz Campos Lindos, pesticide deposits and agrochemical application records were audited. Pesticide deposits on Faz Batavo plots and pesticide application records were audited. "" POP procedure No. 2503 V01 of 2-3-18 - Reduction in the use of Paraquat was highlighted, with the aim of reducing the use of this active ingredient in drying soybean plantations.

Also on another farm, the commitment to dealing with any complaints or grievances received in an appropriate and timely manner was not clear, leading to non-compliance in indicator 3.3.3.","Employment opportunities on the farms are always offered preferably to the local community, being publicized internally or on the municipalitys SINE. Some of the farms audited provide facilities and machinery for SENAR to carry out training. Only on two of the farms audited is there no collaboration with training programs aimed at the local population, which led to non-conformities in indicator 3.4.2.","The farms have a Socio-Environmental Diagnosis developed by the manager. Only one of the audited farms, which was recently included in the group, does not have the diagnosis, which led to non-compliance in items 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.1.4 and 4.1.5.","No fires are carried out on any of the audited farms. Most of the waste is properly disposed of by the farms, however non-conformities were identified in two of the farms audited. Non-conformities in item 4.2.2 were identified due to used oil being used to maintain fences on one of the properties; fluorescent lamps are not separated into two properties; batteries are buried alongside common trash on one of the properties. Non-conformities were also identified in item 4.2.4 as the two farms bury non-biological waste on the properties. On one of the farms there is no suitable lane for washing machines, which led to non-compliance in indicator 4.2.3. On another farm, a non-compliance with indicator 4.2.5 was identified as there was no documented Waste Management Plan. All farms have a fuel tank with containment dam, channels and separator boxes. The properties houses have septic tanks.","Only one of the audited farms does not record the use of fossil fuels, leading to non-compliance in indicator 4.3.1.

The farms only use agrochemicals permitted for soybean cultivation and in the dosages prescribed by the technicians responsible, as evidenced in the deposits and records of agrochemical use.","All audited farms record the use of pesticides, however in On two farms the records do not include the names of the dosers/applicators, the identification of the application equipment used, nor the weather conditions during applications, which led to non-conformities in indicator 5.5.1. On all farms, empty packaging is washed at the time of application and delivered to reception centers. Most farms have empty packaging storage in accordance with regulations, closed, locked, fenced with mesh and covered. However, one of the farms did not have a warehouse and the empty packaging was stored in big bags until delivery to the receiving units, which led to non-compliance in indicator 5.5.2. All farms have agrochemical deposits and most are in compliance with standards, covered, closed, locked, signposted, with floors, emergency showers and eyewash stations. However, on one of the farms audited, the deposit does not have channels or a containment box. On the same farm, contaminated PPE is washed in the accommodation laundry by the employees themselves. Both situations led to non-compliance in indicator 5.5.3. On all audited farms, areas treated with pesticides are demarcated with signposts. Recommendations for the use of amendments and fertilizers are made by agronomists based on the results of soil analyses.","The farms do not use any agrochemicals listed in the Stockholm and Rotterdam Conventions. Some farms still use Paraquat, but it is already planned to gradually reduce its use by 2020, and it is no longer being purchased.","Not all farms use biological control agents, but they demonstrate knowledge about use of the same.","If an outbreak of new pests occurs, farms resort to institutions such as EMBRAPA, FAMATO, INDEA and the Rural Union.","Measures implemented by farms to prevent drift include monitoring weather conditions during applications, only carrying them out under suitable conditions, in addition to the use of correctly calibrated spraying equipment. Critical areas such as water bodies and residential areas are also observed. One of the farms presented non-compliance in item 5.9.2 for not recording the observed climatic conditions. On another farm, it was found that land applications of pesticides are carried out at distances less than 30 meters from residences, which led to non-conformity in indicator 5.9.5.","The production systems adopted by the farms are similar to neighbor systems. None of the farms have sensitive crops close to them, such as organic farming or Non-GMO soybeans. There is no history of damage to neighboring areas caused by drift from the audited properties.","None of the farms produce their own seeds.
